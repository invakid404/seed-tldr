# locate

> Find filenames quickly.
> More information: <https://manned.org/locate>.

- Look for pattern in the database. Note: the database is recomputed periodically (usually weekly or daily):

`locate {{pattern}}`

- Look for a file by its exact filename (a pattern containing no globbing characters is interpreted as `*pattern*`):

`locate '*/{{filename}}'`

- Recompute the database. You need to do it if you want to find recently added files:

`sudo updatedb`
